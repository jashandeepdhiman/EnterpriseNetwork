# 🏢 Enterprise Network Design — Cisco Packet Tracer

This project simulates a full-scale enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed with scalability, security, and segmentation in mind, following a 3-tier architecture.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🔹 3-Tier Network Design (Core, Distribution, Access)
- 🔹 6 Departments: Sales, HR, Finance, Admin, ICT, Server Room
- 🔹 Separate VLANs & Subnets per department
- 🔹 DHCP Server Configuration
- 🔹 Redundant Switches & Links (STP)
- 🔹 Console & VTY Access Security (SSH, Passwords)
- 🔹 Static and Dynamic Routing

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLANs & Subnetting
- DHCP, DNS
- STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
- SSH Access
- Routing Protocols

## 📁 Files

- `enterprise-network.pkt` — The Packet Tracer project file

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add network documentation (topology diagrams, IP tables)
- Implement basic ACLs for traffic control
- Simulate failover and network testing
